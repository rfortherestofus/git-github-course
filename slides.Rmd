They're not the same thing

You can use one without the other

TODO: Image of Git vs GitHub

### Git

Version control system **on your local computer**

--

Allows you to take **snapshots** of your code as it progresses

--

Allows you to view the **history of your code over time**

Update RStudio

Update all packages (may cause issues, but worth it)

### R

---

### RStudio

---

### R Packages

---

## Install Git

Check version on Mac, update if necessary, something with xcode?

### Windows

TODO: Set up Windows VM (see https://www.viget.com/articles/set-up-a-windows-10-virtual-machine-and-browser-test-ie-11-and-edge-on-mac/)

---

## Configure Git

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name = "Jane Doe", user.email = "jane@example.org")
```

???

Explain that you can do lots of things on command line, but I'm showing how not to do so
