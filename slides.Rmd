TODO: Image of Git vs GitHub

### Git

--

Version control system **on your local computer**

--

Allows you to take **snapshots** of your code as it progresses

--

Allows you to view the **history of your code over time**


---

Then pull and deal with conflicts if they happen

## Merge Conflicts

---

## Merge Conflicts Are Not Unique to Git/GitHub

--

![](images/dropbox-conflicted-copy.webp)


???

With Dropbox, you have to manually copy in pieces you want to keep

---

## Merge Conflicts

When you and someone else edit the same code

--

Git shows you where conflicts are ...

--

But it's up to you to decide which code to keep

---

## How to Deal With Merge Conflicts

![](images/git-conflicts.svg)


???

> To see the beginning of the merge conflict in your file, search the file for the conflict marker <<<<<<<. When you open the file in your text editor, you'll see the changes from the HEAD or base branch after the line <<<<<<< HEAD. Next, you'll see =======, which divides your changes from the changes in the other branch, followed by >>>>>>> BRANCH-NAME. In this example, one person wrote "open an issue" in the base or HEAD branch and another person wrote "ask your question in IRC" in the compare branch or branch-a.

## Let's Keep Bad Things from Happening in the First Place



---

### Always Pull Before Pushing

> Before you try to push code out to the repository, you should always pull all the current changes from the remote repository to your local machine. Doing so will ensure that your local copy is in sync with the remote repository. Remember, other people have been pushing to the remote copy, and if you push before syncing up, you could end up with multiple heads or merge conflicts when you push.

Source: [Nick Hodges](https://betterprogramming.pub/six-rules-for-good-git-hygiene-5006cf9e9e2)


---

### Push Early and Often

--

> If you had pushed D first, you’d be relaxing and they’d be figuring out how to integrate C into their history in order to push. So push your work often. Don’t go dark and work “offline” for long stretches of time.

Source: [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/push-rejected.html#she-who-pushes-first-wins)


---

### Commit Regularly

--

> If you feel the need to use the word “and” in your commit message, you are probably not committing often enough.

Source: [Nick Hodges](https://betterprogramming.pub/six-rules-for-good-git-hygiene-5006cf9e9e2)



---

### Use Branches

Let's dive in!


---

class: inverse, middle, center

background-image:url("images/branches.jpg")

# Branches


---

## What are Branches?

--

![](images/git-branch.svg)

???

Copy of your code that you can work on while leaving your main branch as is

Start with example of API website: what if I want to make changes but not mess it up

---

## You've Used “Branches”

--

![](images/word-branches.svg)

---

class: center, middle

## Git Branches Make Things Much Simpler 

???

Show me working in project and making a v2 version of Rmd file and then switching to Git approach and making a new branch

---


## Why Use Branches?

--

1. You've got a working version in the main branch **you don't want to mess up**

--

1. You can **test something out** and only merge it back into the main branch if it works


---

## Branch Names

--

Historically, the default branch was called **master**

--

Recently, people have recognized **master** is problematic and shifted to using **main** instead

???

Pan on https://sfconservancy.org/news/2020/jun/23/gitbranchname/
https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2021/10/renaming-default-branch/
https://www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/git-moving-master-to-main/



---

## How to Switch Master to Main in Your Current Project


```{r}
library(usethis)
git_default_branch_rename()
```


---

## How to Use Main in Future Projects


```{r}
library(usethis)
git_default_branch_configure()
```

???

TODO: For learn more, add link to post on how to change all old branches

---

background-image:url("images/create-branch.jpg")

class: inverse, middle, center

## How to Create Branches

---

### Create a New Branch

![](images/create-branch.png)


???

- Show it on RStudio
- Highlight that you can do whatever in branch and it won't affect main
- Show that you can see which branch you're in by looking at git tab
- Make commits on branch (show these commits on GH)

---

### Changes Only Impact the Current Branch

???

- Show how you can alter files and it doesn't change main


---

## How to Merge Back Into the Main Branch

--

You can't do this within RStudio

--

You can merge directly using the command line or a tool like GitHub Desktop

--

But I recommend that you use **pull requests** instead


---

class: center, middle

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
tweetrmd::tweet_embed("https://twitter.com/dgkeyes/status/1450498518993424389",
                      align = "center")
```

???

Show responses and how this changed my thinking


---


## Pull Requests

--

- GitLab calls them [merge requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/), which is a more descriptive name

--

- They're a way to say, "I've done some thing and I'm ready to merge my code back into the main branch"

--

- Can include multiple commits

---

### How to Create a Pull Request

![](images/gh-branches.png)

---

#### How to Create a Pull Request

Find branch you want to use for your pull request and click new pull request

![](images/gh-new-pull-request.png)

---

#### How to Create a Pull Request

Name your pull request and add any comments

![](images/gh-pull-request-screen.png)

---

### Anatomy of a Pull Request

![](images/gh-pull-request-merge.png)

???

Conversation
Commits
Checks
Files changed
Reviewers


---


### How to Review a Pull Request

1. Open pull request
1. Review it
1. Discuss changes in conversation
1. When ready, merge pull request
1. Delete branch if desired


---

class: center, middle

### How to Close a Pull Request

---

#### No merge conflicts? Merge away!

![](images/gh-pull-request-merge.png)


???

- Delete branch if desired

---

#### Deal with merge conflicts on GitHub

What if you have merge conflict on PR

???

https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github



---

### Use Pull Requests Even When Working Solo


```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
tweetrmd::tweet_embed("https://twitter.com/apreshill/status/1363104026460577793",
                      align = "center")
