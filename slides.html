They're not the same thing

You can use one without the other

TODO: Image of Git vs GitHub

---

### Git

--

Version control system **on your local computer**

--

Allows you to take **snapshots** of your code as it progresses

--

Allows you to view the **history of your code over time**


---

class: middle, center

---

class: inverse

# Your Turn

--

1. Install Git

--

1. Confirm that you installed Git correctly by going to your terminal in RStudio and typing `git --version` (you should have version 2.3 or later)

---

## Configure Git

--

Let's tell Git who we are!

--



```r
install.packages("usethis") # Only if usethis is not installed
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name = "Jane Doe", user.email = "jane@example.org")
```


???

Explain that you can do lots of things on command line, but I'm showing how not to do so

---

class: inverse

### Your Turn

## Commits

???

Commits are a snapshot of your code at any point

Staging files

Commit messages

---

## Commits are Snapshots

--

![](images/git-visual.svg)

---

## Commits Have Two Parts

--

Part 1: Files you **stage** (i.e. include) 

--

Part 2: A **commit message** that tells you what has changed since the last commit

---

### Staging Files

--

Which files do you want to include in this commit? 

--

Include all files for now

--

## Two Options

&lt;br&gt;

--

![](images/github-to-rstudio.svg)

--
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

![](images/rstudio-to-github.svg)

---

## Push an RStudio Project to a GitHub Repository

![](images/rstudio-to-github.svg)

---

### Step 1: Initialize a **local** git repository in your RStudio project


```r
use_git()
```

---

### Step 2: Connect your local RStudio project to a **remote GitHub repository**


```r
use_github()
```



---

class: inverse

### Your Turn

--

1. Open the `local-first` project you created previously

--

1. Push your `local-first` project to GitHub using the `use_github()` function from the `usethis` package

---

## Pull a GitHub Repository to an RStudio Project

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
![](images/github-to-rstudio.svg)

---

### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub

---

class: middle, center

[![](images/github-new-repo.png)](https://github.com/new)

---

### Step 2: Create a New RStudio Project by Cloning a GitHub Repository

.center[
  ![](images/clone-repo.png)
]


---

class: inverse

### Your Turn

--

1. Create a new repository on GitHub called `github-first`

--

1. Create a new project in RStudio by cloning the `github-first` GitHub repository you just created


---

## Keeping RStudio and GitHub in Sync

--

1. Work in RStudio

--

1. Any time you make significant changes, make a commit

--

1. Push your work to GitHub

???

- Talk about staging, commits again

- Finish off by saying you don't need to pull if you're the only one working on the project, but this becomes necessary when you collaborate

---



class: inverse

### Your Turn

--

1. Create a README.md in the `github-first` project and add some text

--

1. Stage this file (and any other modified files) and add a commit message

--

1. Hit commit

--

1. After you commit, push your changes to GitHub

--

1. Go to your GitHub repository and make sure you see your changes

## Why Use GitHub vs Dropbox, Google Drive, Box, etc? 

---

## With GitHub, Many People Can Work on the Same Project at Same Time

--

![](images/git-collaboration4.svg)

???

People work individually on code

Then push

Then pull and deal with conflicts if they happen

Make example of me working and not being able to pull in changes

Have changes locally that you haven't committed which you need to do before pulling

## Merge Conflicts

--

This is not unique to Git/GitHub

--

![](images/dropbox-conflicted-copy.webp)


???

With Dropbox, you have to manually copy in pieces you want to keep

---

## Merge Conflicts

--

When you and someone else edit the same code

--

Git shows you where conflicts are ...

--

And then lets you decide which version to keep


---

## Merge Conflicts

Open file with conflicts

Look for the conflict marker &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

Look for the divider  =======

Look for the end conflict marker &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

???

&gt; To see the beginning of the merge conflict in your file, search the file for the conflict marker &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;. When you open the file in your text editor, you'll see the changes from the HEAD or base branch after the line &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD. Next, you'll see =======, which divides your changes from the changes in the other branch, followed by &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BRANCH-NAME. In this example, one person wrote "open an issue" in the base or HEAD branch and another person wrote "ask your question in IRC" in the compare branch or branch-a.

## Let's Keep Bad Things from Happening 


---

### Commit Regularly

--

&gt; If you feel the need to use the word “and” in your commit message, you are probably not committing often enough.

Source: [Nick Hodges](https://betterprogramming.pub/six-rules-for-good-git-hygiene-5006cf9e9e2)


---

### Push Early and Often

--

&gt; If you had pushed D first, you’d be relaxing and they’d be figuring out how to integrate C into their history in order to push. So push your work often. Don’t go dark and work “offline” for long stretches of time.

Source: [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/push-rejected.html#she-who-pushes-first-wins)


---

### Always Pull Before Pushing

&gt; This is a bedrock rule. Before you try to push code out to the repository, you should always pull all the current changes from the remote repository to your local machine. Doing so will ensure that your local copy is in sync with the remote repository. Remember, other people have been pushing to the remote copy, and if you push before syncing up, you could end up with multiple heads or merge conflicts when you push.

---

# Use Branches

---

class: dk-section-title, inverse, middle, center

background-image:url("images/branches.jpg")

# Branches


---

## What are Branches?

Copy of your code that you can work on while leaving your main branch as is

---

## Why Use Branches?

- You've got a working version in the main branch

- You want to test something out and only use it if it works

- Work on Your Code Without Messing Up Things that are Working



---

## Branch Names

Talk about master vs main

Show how to change name of master to main: 


```r
library(usethis)
git_default_branch_configure()
```


???

https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2021/10/renaming-default-branch/
https://www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/git-moving-master-to-main/

---

## How Do We Create a New Branch? 

- Show it on RStudio



---

## How Do We Merge Our Work Back Into the Main Branch?

- Can't do this within RStudio


---


## Pull Requests

- GitLab calls them merge requests, which is a more descriptive name

---

### Pull Requests

Can package up a series of changes and allow someone else to review them before merging into main

---

### How to Create a Pull Request

Go to branches on GitHub

Find branch you want to use for your pull request

Hit the new pull request button

---

### No merge conflicts? Merge away!

- Delete branch if desired

---

### Deal with merge conflicts on GitHub

What if you have merge conflict on PR

???

---


### How to Deal with Someone Else's Pull Request

Open PR

Review it

Discuss changes

When ready, merge PR

Delete branch if desired

# Cool Stuff You Can Do with GitHub

---

## Publish using Netlify

- Mention that GH pages exists but I don't like it because it's slow

---

## GitHub Actions

- Use a single example (e.g. update report every night and make new commit, thus pushing it to Netlify)
